# Awesome Ambience Scenes

A curated list of awesome ambient scenes for listening while working.

Welcome to the world of “Scenes”—an emerging form of digital art that
harmoniously blends ambient music or noise with captivating visual environments.
These videos combine 3D-modeled or AI-generated art with chill, ambient sounds,
and sometimes include descriptive text to enhance the experience. Designed
to be played on a second monitor while you work or relax, “Scenes” offer a
tranquil and immersive backdrop. This art form fuses drawing, 3D modeling,
semi-generative music, and video editing into a cohesive whole. Dive into this
curated list of channels to explore and enjoy this captivating new genre.
